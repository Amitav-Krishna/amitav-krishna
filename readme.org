* Hello!
My name is Amitav Krishna! Here's a little bit about me:

- I enjoy mathematics,
- I enjoy programming,
- I enjoy riding my bicycle,
- I'm currently working on making vibecode-resistant interview questions for [[https://8090.ai][8090 Solutions]].
Right now, I'm also working on [[https://github.com/amitav-krishna/llm-from-scratch][building an LLM from scratch]] in C++ using just the standard library. You can find my website at [[amitav.net]].

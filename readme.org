* Hello!
My name is Amitav Krishna! Here's a little bit about me:
- I'm currently working on making vibecode-resistant interview questions for [[https://8090.ai][8090 Solutions]],
- I'm researching novel architecture-loss combinations for quantum error reduction to reduce Cloud computing costs for researchers. You can see my very scuffed draft [[https://amitav.net/paper_v1.5.pdf][here]] and my GitHub for this [[https://github.com/amitav-krishna/transformer_for_reducing_quantum_noise][here]],
- On the side, I'm using Google Jules to build a decentralized, BitTorrent-like protocol for AI inference. [[https://github.com/amitav-krishna/gpu_torrent][GitHub]].

Email me: amitavkrishna@proton.me (home), akrishna0511@bhncdsb.ca (school), amitav@8090.inc (work). Resume @ [[https://amitav.net/resume][my website]].

Live long and /prosper/!
